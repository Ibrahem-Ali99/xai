# Explainable AI in Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on leveraging Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to analyze and predict employee attrition. The goal is to investigate the reasons behind different AI models predictions on the [IBM Employee Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).


## Project Overview

The project involves a comparative analysis of 12 machine learning models for employee attrition prediction that are available in the `notebooks` directory.


## Implemented Models

The following models are implemented and available in the `notebooks` directory:

1. AdaBoost
2. Decision Tree
3. Deep Neural Network (DNN)
4. Extra Tree Classifier
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
7. Naive Bayes
8. Random Forest
9. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
10. XGBoost
11. Logistic Regression
12. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)


## Directory Structure

- **Images/**: Contains visualizations such as confusion matrices and feature importance plots for the implemented models.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each model, detailing the implementation and analysis.
- **preprocessing-eda/**: Contains the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis notebook.
